# io-monitor

## Overview

This is a thin shim intended to be used with **LD_PRELOAD** in order
to capture/intercept many C library calls for the purpose of
getting real-time metrics without having to change any existing
source code. The idea is that relevant metrics should be
captured very efficiently and then handed off to another process
to handle.

## IPC Mechanism

The preferred IPC mechanism is **Unix SysV message queues**. In order
to make use of the captured metrics, you must set the environment
variable **MESSAGE_QUEUE_PATH** to an existing file where user has
permissions for writing.

## Identifying Metrics

Each captured metric has an **operation type** to identify the kind
of operation that generated the metric. In some cases, the specified
operation is a family of functions grouped by functionality.
For example, the 'OPEN' operation on files can be one of the
following functions: open, open64, creat, creat64, fopen, fopen64.

Every operation type belongs to a **domain**. The domain is simply
a grouping mechanism to treat a certain logically related set
of operations as one (e.g., to enable/disable monitoring).

## Environment Variables

| Variable           | Required? | Description |
| ------             | --------- | ----------- |
| FACILITY_ID        | N         | Identifies the component. defaults to 'u' |
| MESSAGE_QUEUE_PATH | Y         | File path of existing file associated with SysV message queue |
| MONITOR_DOMAINS    | Y         | list of comma-separated domains to monitor or 'ALL' |
| START_ON_OPEN      | N         | starts paused, resumes on open of specified file |
| START_ON_ELAPSED   | N         | starts paused, resumes on elapsed time crossing specified threshold |

## System requirements

This program should work on any Linux distribution. For build, in addition to standard
toolchain, you will need indent utility.

## START_ON_OPEN

START_ON_OPEN causes io monitor to start in paused mode. It will remain paused until a
file is opened whose path contains (substring) the value specified by this variable. 

In some cases, there may be a great deal of unwanted captures that occur when process
is first started. An example would be running a Python program. When the Python
interpreter starts it reads many files as part of its initialization.

The START_ON_OPEN feature can prevent such undesirable startup noise. If you set a
value for the environment variable 'START_ON_OPEN', the monitor will start in 'paused'
mode. It will remain paused until a file open operation occurs with the file path
containing the specified value. 

For example, you might set START_ON_OPEN as:

    export START_ON_OPEN="hello_world.txt"

for a Python program that begins by opening the file "hello_world.txt". This technique
would prevent the normal Python initialization traffic from being captured by the monitor.

| error code        | integer error code. 0 = success; non-zero = errno in most cases |
